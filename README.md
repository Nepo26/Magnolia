# Onibas-Grant

A place to store most part of my test codes related to my IEC(Introducao a Engenharia de Computacao)'s project. Which consisted of the attempt to intercommunicate a raspberry pi, a camera, a telegram bot, and a servo motor (to open a lock).


## Original Idea

I came up with the idea for the integration between those components after i had seen a similar project on the internet. The project basically consisted of a camera that after seeing a face would trigger a bot on the raspberry pi informing the "owner" of the camera about it. I wished to replicate it, then i tried.
